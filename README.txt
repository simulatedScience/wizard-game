# Wizard card game

This project implements a digital version of the popular card game Wizard published by Amigo using python.

The goal is to train different AIs to play the game and allow humans to play against those AIs.

Currently the game is playable for humans and parts of the infrastructure to implement AIs are in place.

It's unlikely that I will add the option of online multiplayer.
